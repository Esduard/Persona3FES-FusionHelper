Context:

group of n recipes indexed on j=0..n-1

group of m tags indexed on i=0..m-1


Parameters:

aij = 1 if recipe indexed at j covers tag indexed at i
aij = 0 otherwise

the matrix a is in a txt file called 'matrix_a.txt'

Variables:

xj = 1 if recipe is selected
xj = 0 otherwise

Objective Function:

minimize sum(xj, j=0..n-1)

Constraints:

sum(aij * xj, j=0..n-1) >= 1 where i=0..m-1

xj belongs to {0,1} for each j
